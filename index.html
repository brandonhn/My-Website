            I had the wonderful opportunity of being introduced into the financial markets from Bloomberg first hand. Through their 
            program, I learned how to utilize the Bloomberg Terminal in order to analyze security performances, present analyzed information
            utilizing graphs and visual statistics, and learned about market and financial concepts through Bloomberg University and the
            Bloomberg Market Course.

            PowerBI visualization.

          <h3 class="ASL-title">American Sign Language</h3>
          <p class="ASL-text">Sign Language is an underappreciated and valuable asset in many communities. With my
            grandfather and
            father developing hearing deficiency, it became more urgent for me to dive deeper into American Sign Language.
            While
            only having a few years of experience, I took it upon myself to teach those unaware of the art while in high
            school. As the
            president of the American Sign Language Club, I taught introductory and practical ASL and organized deaf socials
            to expose the new
            club members to. It was an amazing experience being able to contribute to the deaf community as well as expose
            those
            blessed with proper-functioning senses to a world out of our radar.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is an article about my experience with introducing American Sign Language to my High School.

          <p class="piano-text">My mother was a former piano teacher in Vietnam; it was inevitable that (*stereotype joke*)
            I, an asian-born son to a musical mother,
            would lay my <br>hands on the musical instrument mum loved most. I've been taught by my <br>mother since I was
            six and participated in local and state competitions. I <br>won a few local
            tournaments before I stopped partaking in competition and <br>began to play more casually. Nowadays, I
            absolutely enjoy playing songs I <br>like, mainly video game music and
            anime tracks on piano. I have since started <br>a YouTube channel that I occasionally upload playings of songs I
            enjoy.

            <p>Growing up in a buddhist family, my parents taught me that the greatest treasure is to give. In regards to
              such philosophy,
              I find it most transparent and true when it comes teaching others. For me, the process of being able to help
              others understand something new, something they may struggle with,
              and getting more personal with them is an extremely gratifying experience. With or without pay, I always find
              the act of teaching so rewarding. Since the age of 15, I have voluntarily
              tutored at my local Buddhist meditation center, Compassionate Eyes Inc. for Buddhist children every summer. In
              High School, I was part of the Barons After School Academics, a system of private tutoring
              where parents reached out to me for tutoring their students in a more professional manner. Finally, I have also worked with children of a diverse age range whilst at
              Kumon, teaching Math and Reading from levels K-12. Each of these experiences have brought me pure joy; just
              being able to see the smiles on those I've helped makes my day so worthwhile. Ideally, I would love to further
              the progression and development of education for those in need, financing for better institutions and perhaps teaching in my retirement
              and providing individualized impact.

            <p>Some of my most prominent hobbies are practicing and analyzing martial arts, board games (in particular
              Settlers of Catan), and watching anime / reading manga.
              I have been engaged in multiple forms of martial arts since the age of 6, including Aikido (11 years), Kendo
              (2 years), Karate (2 years), and Boxing (2 years). As an avid board game player,
              I enjoy spending 'board game nights' with friends, playing Monopoly, Monopoly Deal, Settlers of Catan, etc,
              and am excited to try new ones! I am also a huge anime enthusiast! My childhood was built on anime
              and manga, and I am an active attender of Anime Conventions. If you share any of these interests, I would love
              to talk more about them with you!
