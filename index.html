            I was an undergraduate researcher my freshman year at UCSD, under Professor Adalbert Gerald. In researching how to better
            teach programming languages to non-English natives, I was responsible for organizing presentations, reading and compiling
            data from our study and others, supplement the final paper with my own thesis, and refine it for presentation at the Association
            of Computing Machinery.

            The fellowship at the Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America career institute was my turning point for my immersion

            and talks from industry leaders. The things I've learned, people I've interacted with, and exploration of my innate talents there 
            led me towards my passion for the business field.

            The Fresh Air Fund is a social outreach program for young children. There, I served as a mentor and virtual counselor
            for its summer coding and video game design program. My role required me to help supervise and assist instruction in a group of 
            36 high schoolers, flexibly help with their code in breakout rooms ranging from one to six people, and log down each student's progress,
            performance and progression via Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

          <h3 class="ASL-title">American Sign Language</h3>
          <p class="ASL-text">Sign Language is an underappreciated and valuable asset in many communities. With my
            grandfather and
            father developing hearing deficiency, it became more urgent for me to dive deeper into American Sign Language.
            While
            only having a few years of experience, I took it upon myself to teach those unaware of the art while in high
            school. As the
            president of the American Sign Language Club, I taught introductory and practical ASL and organized deaf socials
            to expose the new
            club members to. It was an amazing experience being able to contribute to the deaf community as well as expose
            those
            blessed with proper-functioning senses to a world out of our radar.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is an article about my experience with introducing American Sign Language to my High School.
            <br>

          <h3 class="ASL-title">Piano</h3>
          <p class="piano-text">My mother was a former piano teacher in Vietnam; it was inevitable that (*stereotype joke*)
            I, an asian-born son to a musical mother,
            would lay my <br>hands on the musical instrument mum loved most. I've been taught by my <br>mother since I was
            six and participated in local and state competitions. I <br>won a few local
            tournaments before I stopped partaking in competition and <br>began to play more casually. Nowadays, I
            absolutely enjoy playing songs I <br>like, mainly video game music and
            anime tracks on piano. I have since started <br>a YouTube channel that I occasionally upload playings of songs I
            enjoy.

          <div class="tutor-text">
            <p>Growing up in a buddhist family, my parents taught me that the greatest treasure is to give. In regards to
              such philosophy,
              I find it most transparent and true when it comes teaching others. For me, the process of being able to help
              others understand something new, something they may struggle with,
              and getting more personal with them is an extremely gratifying experience. With or without pay, I have had an
              abundance of tutoring experience. Since the age of 15, I have voluntarily
              tutored at my local Buddhist meditation center, Compassionate Eyes Inc. for Buddhist children every summer. In
              High School, I was part of the Barons After School Academics, a system of private tutoring
              where parents reached out to me for tutoring their students in a more professional manner; I have tutored
              multiple students over long and consistent durations and am capable of drawing
              my references from said parents. Finally, I have also worked with children of a diverse age range whilst at
              Kumon, teaching Math and Reading from levels K-12. Each of these experiences have brought me pure joy; just
              being able to see the smiles on those I've helped makes my day so worthwhile.

              I have been engaged in multiple forms of martial arts since the age of 6, including Aikido (11 years), Kendo
              (2 years), Karate (2 years), and Boxing (2 years). As an avid board game player,
              I enjoy spending 'board game nights' with friends, playing Monopoly, Monopoly Deal, Settlers of Catan, etc,
              and am excited to try new ones! I am also a huge anime enthusiast! My childhood was built on anime
              and manga, and I am an active attender of Anime Conventions. If you share any of these interests, I would love
              to talk more about them with you!
